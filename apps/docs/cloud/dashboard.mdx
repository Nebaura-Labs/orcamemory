## Overview

The Orca Memory dashboard at [app.orcamemory.com](https://app.orcamemory.com) provides a complete view of your project's memory and usage.

## Memories

The **Memories** page displays all stored memories for your project.

### Viewing Memories

Each memory card shows:
- **Content** - The stored information
- **Type** - Episodic, semantic, procedural, or working
- **Tags** - Associated labels for organization
- **Created** - When the memory was stored

### Searching Memories

Use the search bar to find memories by:
- Content keywords
- Tags
- Memory type

The search uses semantic matching, so you can search by meaning, not just exact text.

### Memory Details

### Linking a New Agent

## Sessions

When session logging is enabled, the **Sessions** page shows your conversation history.

Each session includes:
- Timestamp

- Message count
- Full conversation transcript

Sessions help you:
- Review past discussions

- Track project evolution
