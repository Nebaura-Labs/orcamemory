## Overview

The OrcaMemory dashboard at [app.orcamemory.com](https://app.orcamemory.com) provides a complete view of your project's memory and usage.

## Memories

The **Memories** page displays all stored memories for your project.

### Viewing Memories

Each memory card shows:
- **Content** — The stored information
- **Type** — Episodic, semantic, procedural, or working
- **Tags** — Associated labels for organization
- **Created** — When the memory was stored

### Searching Memories

Use the search bar to find memories by:
- Content keywords
- Tags
- Memory type

The search uses semantic matching, so you can search by meaning, not just exact text.

### Memory Details

Click any memory to view its full details, including:
- Complete content
- Metadata
- Related memories
- Edit/delete options

## Sessions

When session logging is enabled, the **Sessions** page shows your conversation history.

Each session includes:
- Timestamp
- Duration
- Message count
- Full conversation transcript

Sessions help you:
- Review past discussions

- Track project evolution

## Agents

The **Agents** page shows all connected agents and their activity.

For each agent, you can see:
- Last active time
- Memory operations (reads/writes)
- Connection status

## Analytics

The **Analytics** page provides insights into your memory usage:

- **Memory count** — Total memories by type
- **API calls** — Reads, writes, and searches over time
- **Storage used** — Current usage vs. plan limits
