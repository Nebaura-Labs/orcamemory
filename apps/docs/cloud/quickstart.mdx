## 1. Create an Account

Go to [app.orcamemory.com](https://app.orcamemory.com) and sign up with your email.

## 2. Create a Project

After signing in, you'll be prompted to create your first project.

1. Click **Create Project**
2. Enter a project name (e.g., "My App")
3. Click **Create**

Your project comes pre-configured with all four memory types enabled.

## 3. Connect Your Agent

Click **Link Agent** on your project to get the connection prompt.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the prompt">
    Click the copy button to copy the OrcaMemory prompt to your clipboard. This includes your API key and endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your agent's rules">
    Paste the prompt into your AI agent's rules file:
    
    | Agent | Rules File |
    |-------|------------|
    | Cursor | `.cursor/rules` or `.cursorrules` |
    | Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
    | Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |
    | Cline | `.clinerules` |
    | GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start coding">
    Your agent now has memory! It will automatically store and retrieve context as you work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Stored?

When connected, your agent will:

- **Remember your preferences** — coding style, frameworks, conventions
- **Track decisions** — why you chose certain approaches
- **Store project knowledge** — architecture, patterns, gotchas
- **Log sessions** — full conversation history for reference

## Environment Variables

The prompt includes two key values:

```bash
ORCA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ORCA_ENDPOINT=https://orcamemory.com/v1
```

These are embedded in the prompt, but you can also set them as environment variables if your agent supports it.
