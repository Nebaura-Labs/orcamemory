## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is OrcaMemory?">
    OrcaMemory is a memory layer for AI coding agents. It enables agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and others to remember context across sessions — your preferences, past decisions, code patterns, and project knowledge.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Which AI agents work with OrcaMemory?">
    Any AI agent that supports custom prompts or rules files can use OrcaMemory, including:
    - Cursor
    - Claude Code
    - Windsurf
    - Cline
    - GitHub Copilot
    - Custom agents using LLM APIs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. We use Convex for data storage, which provides enterprise-grade security. For maximum control, you can self-host OrcaMemory.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use OrcaMemory offline?">
    The cloud version requires internet connectivity. For offline use, you can self-host OrcaMemory on your local network.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cloud

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started?">
    1. Sign up at [app.orcamemory.com](https://app.orcamemory.com)
    2. Create a project
    3. Copy the connection prompt
    4. Paste it into your agent's rules file
    
    See the [Quickstart](/cloud/quickstart) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I hit my plan limits?">
    On the Free plan, requests beyond the daily limit will be rejected. Consider upgrading to Pro for unlimited API calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I delete my data?">
    Yes. You can delete individual memories, entire projects, or your account. All data is permanently removed within 30 days per our retention policy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do you offer a free trial of Pro?">
    New accounts start with a 14-day Pro trial. No credit card required.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Self-Hosting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do I need to self-host?">
    - A Convex account (free tier works)
    - Docker and Docker Compose
    - A server with at least 1GB RAM
    
    See [Requirements](/self-hosting/requirements) for full details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is self-hosting free?">
    The OrcaMemory software is open source and free to self-host. You'll only pay for your own infrastructure (hosting, Convex usage if beyond free tier).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own embedding model?">
    Yes. The embeddings service supports any sentence-transformer model. Configure it via the `EMBEDDING_MODEL` environment variable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I update self-hosted OrcaMemory?">
    Pull the latest code and rebuild:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    npx convex deploy
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My agent isn't storing memories">
    Check that:
    1. The API key is correct in your rules file
    2. The endpoint URL is correct (`https://orcamemory.com/v1`)
    3. Your plan hasn't exceeded its limits
    4. The agent is actually calling the OrcaMemory API (check network requests)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Search isn't returning relevant results">
    Semantic search works best with:
    - Descriptive, natural language queries
    - Memories that have clear, detailed content
    - Appropriate tags for filtering
    
    Try rephrasing your query or lowering the similarity threshold.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm getting rate limited">
    If you're hitting rate limits:
    - Free plan: 60 requests/minute, 1,000/day
    - Upgrade to Pro for higher limits
    - Batch your operations when possible
    - Implement exponential backoff for retries
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The dashboard is slow">
    Large numbers of memories can slow down the dashboard. Try:
    - Filtering by memory type or date range
    - Archiving old memories you don't need
    - Using the search feature instead of scrolling
