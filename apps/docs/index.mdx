## What is Orca Memory?

Orca Memory is a memory plugin for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai). It gives your Claw persistent memory across sessions - so it remembers your preferences, past decisions, code patterns, and project knowledge.

Without memory, your Claw starts fresh every conversation. It forgets your coding style, repeats mistakes, and asks the same questions. Orca Memory fixes this.

## How It Works

Orca Memory is an [OpenClaw plugin](https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugin#plugins). Once installed:

1. **Auto-Recall** - Before each AI response, relevant memories are injected as context
2. **Auto-Capture** - After each turn, important information is extracted and stored
3. **Tools** - Your Claw can manually store, search, and manage memories

## Memory Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Episodic** | Past events and conversations | "Last week we debugged the auth flow" |
| **Semantic** | Facts and knowledge | "This project uses Convex for the backend" |
| **Procedural** | Patterns and preferences | "User prefers arrow functions" |
| **Working** | Active session context | Current task and recent decisions |
