## What is OrcaMemory?

OrcaMemory is a memory layer for AI coding agents. It allows agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, and others to remember context across sessions — your preferences, past decisions, code patterns, and project knowledge.

Without memory, AI agents start fresh every conversation. They forget your coding style, repeat mistakes, and ask the same questions. OrcaMemory fixes this.
