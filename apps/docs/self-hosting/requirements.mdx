description: What you need to self-host OrcaMemory
---

## Overview

OrcaMemory is built on modern infrastructure that you can deploy to your own environment. This guide covers what you'll need.

## Stack

OrcaMemory consists of:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Dashboard | React + Vite | Web interface |
| Backend | Convex | Database, auth, real-time |
| Embeddings | Python + FastAPI | Vector embeddings for search |
| Auth | Better Auth | Authentication |

## Prerequisites

### Convex Account

OrcaMemory uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend. You'll need:

1. A Convex account (free tier available)
2. A new Convex project for OrcaMemory

Convex handles:
- Database storage
- Real-time subscriptions
- Serverless functions
- File storage

### Embedding Service

For semantic search, you need an embedding service. Options:

- **Self-hosted** — Run our Python embeddings service
- **OpenAI** — Use OpenAI's embedding API
- **Other providers** — Any service that returns vector embeddings

### Domain & SSL

For production deployment:
- A domain name
- SSL certificate (use Let's Encrypt or your provider)

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum (Development)

- 1 CPU core
- 1 GB RAM
- 10 GB storage

### Recommended (Production)

- 2+ CPU cores
- 4 GB RAM
- 50 GB SSD storage

The embeddings service is the most resource-intensive component. Consider running it on a GPU-enabled instance for better performance.
